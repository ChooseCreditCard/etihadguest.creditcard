    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is an Airline Loyalty Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>An airline loyalty credit card is linked directly to an airline’s frequent-flyer programme. Instead of earning cashback or generic points, your card spend is converted into airline miles — building a balance that can be redeemed for flights, cabin upgrades or partner flights within the airline’s network.</p>
      <p>Such a card works best for people who fly frequently or travel long-haul. The value you get depends heavily on how often you fly, which routes you use — and whether the airline’s partner network matches your travel preferences.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning Miles -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How Spending and Flights Earn Etihad-Style Miles</h2>
      <p>Everyday spending on the card typically earns a base rate of miles. Many cards also give bonus miles for travel-related purchases: flights, hotel stays, foreign currency transactions or specific partner merchants. This helps build a mileage balance faster, especially if you spend often on travel.</p>
      <p>Flying with the airline or its partners also earns miles — often based on distance, fare class or booking price. Combining regular spending with actual flights tends to yield miles growth faster and unlocks award-worthy balances sooner.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming Miles -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>How to Redeem Miles — Flights, Upgrades & Partner Awards</h2>
      <p>Miles can be redeemed for award tickets, cabin upgrades or partner-airline flights depending on availability and route. Award cost depends on destination, demand, peak vs off-peak dates and seat class — long-haul flights or premium cabins often give the best value per mile.</p>
      <p>However, quality of redemption depends on seat availability, blackout dates and possible carrier-imposed surcharges. Good planning and flexibility often matter as much as the miles accumulated.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Partners & Network -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why Partner Airlines & Alliances Matter</h2>
      <p>Many airline programmes — including those similar to Etihad Guest — partner with other airlines around the world. That means miles earned on one card may give access to flights on partner carriers, increasing your destination options and flexibility.</p>
      <p>When using partners, award costs and fees may vary. Always compare different partner combinations to ensure you get the best value for miles, considering taxes, surcharges and total travel cost.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value & Trade-Offs -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When an Airline Miles Card Makes Sense — and When It Doesn’t</h2>
      <p>If you travel often — especially internationally or long-haul — and are flexible with dates, a loyalty-card tied to miles can pay off. Miles-based redemptions often shine for premium cabins or expensive routes where cash tickets are costly.</p>
      <p>But if you fly rarely, stick to low-cost carriers, or prioritise flexibility over loyalty, a flexible rewards card or cashback card might deliver more consistent value without locking you into one airline’s network.</p>
